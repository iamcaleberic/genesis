# genesis
C code

 > * Make sure you have `GCC` and `C` available for compilation of the raw

###### Running
 - For compiled binaries check binaries folder and execute by `./[NAME_OF_BINARY]`
 - If you prefer compiling yourself do `gcc [NAME_OF_FILE].c -o [OUTPUT_PATH]`
 - Run on [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) if the above makes no sense to you.
